Given a starting guess of the three matrices (followed by the number of emissions and the sequence of emissions itself):
- Transition matrix
- Emission matrix
- Initial state probability distribution 

 Output the estimated transition matrix and emission matrix on one line each in the same matrix format as they were given, including the dimensions
